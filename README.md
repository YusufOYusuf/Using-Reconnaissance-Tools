<h1>Using Reconnaissance Tools</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I learned to use the ipconfig command. Any kind of security assessment can involve a lot of reconnaissance from inside or outside of the network. You want to know as much as you can about the networkâ€™s structure, services, and exposed OSINT before you try to discover their vulnerabilities. They include standard TCP/IP tools, shells and scripting environments, network scanners, and enumeration tools designed to find specific services, accounts, and other elements.
